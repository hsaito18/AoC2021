# AoC2021

Update 2022-06-23: Finished! I ended up doing up to day 23 in December, but then classes started up again and I did not have a lot of spare time. After I finished the term and started co-op, I decided to finally finish 2021. Glad to have done it, was very rewarding in the end!

My attempts for the Advent of Code 2021 edition. Last time I didn't finish, but hopefully this time I'll be able to keep up. Might be kind of difficult with finals happening at the same time.
